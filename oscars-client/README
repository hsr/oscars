This directory contains examples of  how to call the OSCARSService operations from Java.

Before these commands will execute, OSCARS must be built and installed and all the services started.
The env variable OSCARS_HOME must be set to the directory where OSCARS was deployed.


Use mvn nstall to build the programs in examples.
Use the scripts in bin to call the example programs.

Most of these examples use the keytores in $OSCARS_HOME/sampleDomain/certs that were generated when OSCARS was build. They act on behalf of the user "client" which was created by the oscarsDeploy.sh script.

See the GETTINGSTARTED document for more details on how to set up the OSCARS environment.
