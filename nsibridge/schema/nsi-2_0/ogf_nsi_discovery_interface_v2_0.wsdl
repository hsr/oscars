    <!-- OGF NSI Interface Discovery Protocol 2.0 description -->
    <wsdl:documentation>
        This is a web services message definition of OGF NSI Interface
        Discovery protocol version 2.0 based on an HTTP/SOAP binding.
        The Interface Discovery Protocol is message based request-
        response protocol that operates between a Requester Network
        Service Agent (NSA) and a Provider NSA. The protocol is defined
        with a single operation and a generic schema to keep version
        updates to the protocol to a minimum.  There is one primitive
        supported in this version of the protocol.
    
        1. queryServices - The queryServices operation is sent from a Requester
        NSA to a Provider NSA to discover interfaces versions supported
        by the Provider NSA.  This simple request/response interaction
        uses the following messages: 

        queryServicesRequest contains the optional list of interface types
        the requester NSA would like returned from the provider NSA.  All
        supported interface types and versions are returned if the list
        of interface types is empty.
        
        queryServicesResponse contains the list of interface version
        information matching the request.
        
        serviceException contains exception information related to a
        failed request.
