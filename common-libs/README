This is not an actual module, it's here as a placeholder
and to contain the repo subdirectory which will be
used as a Maven repository for common .jar files.

Use a command like this to install more jars to the repo:

mvn deploy:deploy-file -Durl=file:./repo -DrepositoryId=OSCARS -Dfile=./lib/perfsonar.jar -DpomFile=./lib/perfsonar.xml
